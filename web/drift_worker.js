// drift_worker.js
// This file is a placeholder. The actual worker logic is complex and usually provided by the drift package.
// Since we are unable to download the official one, we will try to rely on the fact that we provided the parameter to satisfy the compiler.
// However, at runtime this will likely fail if the worker is actually needed.
// But for `drift_flutter`, it might handle things differently.
